I have implemented the idea of sending the notification using mailchain whenever a user goes live. 

## User Story
User can sign in using their lens profile, then then can start their live session that uses Livepeer. Once the user gets live, it will send email to all the followers of the user using mailchain.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
